Set up ssh on your computer. I like Roger Peng’s guide to setting up password-less logins. Also see github’s guide to generating SSH keys.

Look to see if you have files ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
If not, create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created id_rsa.pub file) into your clipboard. On a Mac, in the terminal/shell, type:

$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Paste your ssh public key into your github account settings.

Go to your github Account Settings
Click “SSH Keys” on the left.
Click “Add SSH Key” on the right.
Add a label (like “My laptop”) and paste the public key into the big text box.
In a terminal/shell, type the following to test it:

$ ssh -T git@github.com
If it says something like the following, it worked:

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does
not provide shell access.

Adding a file to a repository using the command line

On your computer, move the file you'd like to upload to GitHub into the local directory that was created when you cloned the repository.

Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local repository.

Stage the file for commit to your local repository.

$ git add .
# Adds the file to your local repository and stages it for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the file that you've staged in your local repository.

$ git commit -m "Add existing file"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.

$ git push origin your-branch
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote rep

Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line

Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

Create New Repository drop-down
Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

$ git init
Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.

$ git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

$ git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.

Copy remote repository URL field
In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.

$ git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.

$ git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repos
