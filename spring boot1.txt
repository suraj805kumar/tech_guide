Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

Features

    Create stand-alone Spring applications

    Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

    Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

    Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

    Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration

    Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
